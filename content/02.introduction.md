## Introduction

Pairwise overall genome relatedness forms the basis genome-based taxonomic classification and phylogentic analysis.
Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) is a widely-accepted method for estimating genome similarity. 
Massive-scale sequencing of microbial genomes has necessitated a transition to alignment-free estimation of genome relatedness.
A number of alignment-free similarity estimates exist, including several that closely approximate ANI.
