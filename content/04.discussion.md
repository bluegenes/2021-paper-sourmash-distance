## Discussion

K-mer based estimation of sequence identity has been limited to nucleotide sequences of similar size with high sequence identity (>80%),outside of which MinHash Jaccard is less well correlated with sequence identity [@doi:10.1186/s13059-016-0997-x; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-07641-9].

By leveraging the Containment Index of Scaled MinHash sketches with both nucleotide and protein k-mers, we can extend accurate k-mer sequence identity to sequences of different sizes and to >50% Amino Acid Identity.


Cricuolo [@doi:10.12688/f1000research.26930.1] (suggests w/ appropriate correction, nucl MinHash Jaccard can be used up to >65% ANI??)

Here, we utilize Scaled MinHash sketches with Containment to overcome size differences between sequences being compared. 

To accurately estimate sequence identity from sequence files of different sizes(genomes, metagenomes, etc), we employ Scaled Minhash sketches, which enables estimation of the Containment Index.
