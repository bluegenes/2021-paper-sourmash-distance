Here, we apply k-mer based sequence identity estimation to generate taxonomic classification from the compositional results.


apply k-mer based sequence identity estimation with known taxonomic thresholds to report the most likely taxonomy for a given query genome.

While more protein k-mers are shared across genomes within the same genus (and different species), min-set-cov + LCA allows us to find/report the most similar genome.
