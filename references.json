    "abstract": "As the scale of biological data generation has increased, the bottleneck of research has shifted from data generation to analysis. Researchers commonly need to build computational workflows that include multiple analytic tools and require incremental development as experimental insights demand tool and parameter modifications. These workflows can produce hundreds to thousands of intermediate files and results that must be integrated for biological insight. Data-centric workflow systems that internally manage computational resources, software, and conditional execution of analysis steps are reshaping the landscape of biological data analysis and empowering researchers to conduct reproducible analyses at scale. Adoption of these tools can facilitate and expedite robust data analysis, but knowledge of these techniques is still lacking. Here, we provide a series of strategies for leveraging workflow systems with structured project, data, and resource management to streamline large-scale biological analysis. We present these practices in the context of high-throughput sequencing data analysis, but the principles are broadly applicable to biologists working beyond this field.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in studying microbial diversity is whether there is a species boundary and if the boundary can be delineated by a universal genetic discontinuity. To address this question, Jain et al. computed the pairwise average nucleotide identity (ANI) of 91,761 microbial (bacterial and archaeal) genomes (the 90K genome dataset) and found that the ANI values from the 8 billion comparisons follow a strong bimodal distribution . The authors concluded that a clear genetic discontinuum and species boundary were evident from the unprecedented large-scale ANI analysis. As a result, the researchers advocated that an ANI of 95% can be used to accurately demarcate all currently named microbial species. While the FastANI program described in the paper is useful, we argue that the paper’s conclusion of a universal genetic boundary is questionable and resulted from the substantial biased sampling in genome sequencing. We also caution against being overly confident in using 95% ANI for microbial species delineation as the high benchmarks reported in the paper were inflated by using highly redundant genomes.",

    "abstract": "A new approach to rapid sequence comparison, basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), directly approximates alignments that optimize a measure of local similarity, the maximal segment pair (MSP) score. Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.",
